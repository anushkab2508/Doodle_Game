# Doodle_Game
This is a simple implementation of the popular game "Doodle Jump" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves controlling a character (doodler) to jump on platforms and reach higher scores.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game will start automatically.
3. Use the arrow keys (left, right, and up) to control the doodler:
   - Left arrow key: Move left.
   - Right arrow key: Move right.
   - Up arrow key: Move straight up.
4. Jump on platforms to climb higher.
5. The game ends if the doodler falls off the screen.
6. Your score will be displayed at the end of the game.

## Code Overview
The code consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files:

- `index.html`: Contains the game structure and elements.
- `styles.css`: Defines the styles and layout of the game.
- `script.js`: Implements the game logic and interactions.
